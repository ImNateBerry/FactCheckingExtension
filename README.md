## Inspiration
Misinformation and fake news run rampant online with no quick way to check if the information is factual.

## What it does
It is a fact checking Google chrome extension that will evaluate a highlighted statement or webpage for its factualness and bias by using Perplixity's sonar-reasoning-pro API. Once it is done evaluating it returns a score from 0-100 for how factual and biased it is, and it will list the reasoning and sources that it used to do this.

## How we built it
We created an extension that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to read any text chosen by a user and runs this text through Perplexity Sonar reasoning model to create a detailed overview with citations.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to implement the dynamic side panel that opens on a button click. Designing the UI so it would display all of our dynamic data in an easily understandable form.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a google chrome extension for the first time, including a dynamic side panel and button click feature upon user highlighting text. This was the majority of the team's first time using an artificial intelligence API.

## What we learned
We all learned how to create a Google Chrome extension with an easily understandable and space friendly design. 3 of us also have never worked with an AI API before, and we all learned how to work with one.

## What's next for Factify
Publishing our extension to the google chrome webstore. Giving ragmodel context to true sources to allow students or academic writers to use truthful information in their writing.
